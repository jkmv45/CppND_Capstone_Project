Minumum
* Add error response to inconsistent sensor data 
* Add doxygen doc strings
* Create tester for ComputeAPF
* Update README
* Create function to compute Lyapnunov function value each cycle

* Finish main.cpp

Cleanup
* Make helper functions in SimObj their own class
* Look at separating tester file into separate files for each class

Future Work

* Create a data file write class
* Add saturation logic 
* Add leader logic 
* Switch plotting tool to GNUplot
* Make simulation multi-threaded to see how it behaves in an asynchronous architecture
