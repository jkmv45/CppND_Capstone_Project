Minumum
x * Add error response to inconsistent sensor data 
x * Add doxygen doc strings
x * Update README
x * Add a CLI for getting number of agents from user (give at least 3 options)
x * Finish main.cpp

Possible Cleanup
* Make helper functions in SimObj their own class
* Look at separating tester file into separate files for each class

Future Work
* Define more test cases for better coverage
* Create a data file write class
* Add saturation logic 
* Add leader logic 
* Switch plotting tool to GNUplot
* Make simulation multi-threaded to see how it behaves in an asynchronous architecture
* Create function to compute Lyapnunov function value each cycle
* Create tester for ComputeAPF
